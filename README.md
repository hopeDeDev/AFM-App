# AFM(Apostolic Faith Mission) app

Project description:

AFM church app is an application that helps church members and attendees stay connected and engaged with the church community. 
The app will include features such as church news and events notifications, sermon videos, prayer requests, giving and bonus feature which is a member directory allowing church members to create profiles.
For the current app we are using firebase, and  we will be using the bible api for having the bible section in the app.

Contribution:

the project is an open source. However  currently I am working with Precious Myemane a former classmate from WTC which I've added to my contributors  on this
project.

How to install and Run the Project:

You can clone the project, open your ide and make sure you are on the project directory and on the terminal run flutter update of you already have flutter
installed, if not then dun flutter install then flutter update. All the red error messeges should be gone at this point then run the command 'flutter run 
d chrome' for the debbug screen to appear to see the progress.

NP: the app is temporarilly a web app untill my funds for an upgraded version of an android phone get reached to be able to use the android simulator.


The features in detail:

Livestreaming, Sermon: Livestreaming provide access to sermons and events to allows people who are unable to attend in person to still participate and         feel connected to the
      church community. This can be done through platforms such as YouTube Live as we will also create a youtube channel for the videos.

Church News and Events: a one-stop-shop for church news and events, including service times, event details, and church announcements.
      Members can receive push notifications for important updates.
      Users can also  listen to sermons from past services and access transcripts.
      
Giving: 
      Allows members to give tithes and donations directly from their mobile device. This can be done through a secure payment system integrated into           the app.

Prayer Requests: 
      Users can submit prayer requests and receive notifications when others pray for them.

Church Directory: 
      Users can search for and connect with other church members.
